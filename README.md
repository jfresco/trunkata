# trunkata [![Donate on Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/twolfson.png)](https://www.gittip.com/twolfson/)

Truncation utility which preserves HTML tags and content.

This library was created to solve truncating HTML at line breaks rather than at a character index or word. Line breaks are preferred due to the inconsistency of font sizes between browsers.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install trunkata`

```javascript
var trunkata = require('trunkata');
trunkata.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
