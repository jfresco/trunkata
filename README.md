# trunkata [![Donate on Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/twolfson.png)](https://www.gittip.com/twolfson/)

Truncation utility which preserves HTML content and can truncate by lines.

This library was created to solve truncating HTML at line breaks. This is preferred since browsers are inconsistent with font-sizes and where they choose to break, making words and character indexes useless.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install trunkata`

```javascript
var trunkata = require('trunkata');
trunkata.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
